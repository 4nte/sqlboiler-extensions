# SQLBoiler extensions

## Why?

[SQLBoiler](https://github.com/volatiletech/sqlboiler) generated models don't come with supports for bulk operations such as bulk insert, upsert, delete and they don't provide any mechanism to overcome the RDBMS limitations such as max number of parameters in a query or statement.

## How-to

See the [demo](https://github.com/tiendc/sqlboiler-extensions-demo)
